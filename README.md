voussoir's Sublime Text 2 config
================================

If you download this you can feel what it's like to be me. Copy these folders to your Sublime packages folder, or create junctions / symlinks in that folder which point to these.

To use the color scheme, your preferences file should contain the line:

    "color_scheme": "Packages/voussoir/voussoir.tmTheme"

To use the theme, your preferences file should contain the line:

    "theme": "voussoir.sublime-theme"
